            <h3>Reading</h3>
              <p> Immersing myself in the pages of a book is my sanctuary, where i lose myself in vivid worlds and thought provoking narratives. Whether it's fiction tranporting me to fatastical realms or non-fiction enriching my mind with new ideas, reading fuels my imagination and broadens my perspective on life.</p>
              <h3>Watching</h3>
              <p>Whether it's gripping drama, a thrilling action movie, or a captivating documentary, watching films and Tv shows is my way of unwinding and escaping reality for a while. Each story i watch unfolds a new adventure, evoke a range of emotions, and leaves me with valuable insights that linger long after the screen fades to black. </p>
              <h3>Learning new musical instrument</h3>
